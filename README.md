### Terms & Conditions:

- It is strictly prohibited to make any changes on the QRCD dataset, given that the answers to the questions were carefully extracted from the Holy Qur'an and then annotated by Qur'an Scholars.
- Considering that there are different schools of thought in Islam, the QRCD dataset represents a sample and not all schools of thought.
- Any suggestions for adding or refining the answers of existing questions (or adding new questions and answers) can be directed to the Qur'an QA 2023 organizers, who in turn must solicit the feedback of Qur'an scholars before effecting any updates on the QRCD dataset.
- We note that answer spans can only be extracted from their corresponding verse-based *direct* answers in the *AyaTEC* dataset. Only Qur'an scholars can decide if a verse-based answer represents a *direct* or *indirect* answer to a given question. For a formal definition of a *direct* and *indirect* answer, refer to the [*AyaTEC* paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3400396) (p 11).

This repository contains the following:
* The [*QRCD* (Qur'anic Reading Comprehension Dataset)](https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/tree/main/datasets)
* A [*reader* script](https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/tree/main/code) for the dataset.
* A [*submission checker* script]( https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/tree/main/code) for checking the correctness of run files to be submitted. 
* An [*evaluation* (or *scorer*) script]( https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/tree/main/code).

QRCD is composed of 1,093 tuples of question-passage pairs that are coupled with their extracted answers to constitute 1,337 question-passage-answer triplets. The distribution of the dataset into training, development and test sets is shown below.


| **Dataset** | **%** | **# Question-Passage  Pairs** | **# Question-Passage-Answer  Triplets** |
|-------------|:-----:|:-----------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| Training    |  65%  |              710              |                   861                   |
| Development |  10%  |              109              |                   128                   |
| Test*       |  25%  |              ~~274~~ 238              |                   ~~348~~ 300                   |
| All         |  100% |              1,093            |                  1,337                  |

**For fairness we had to remove some questions and their answers from the test dataset used in the evaluation of the shared task. As such, 238 (instead of 274) question-passage pairs with their corresponding 300 (instead of 348) question-passage-answer triplets were used to evaluate the particpating teams. Nevertheless, we publish both test dataset versions in the [datasets folder](https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/tree/main/datasets).*   

To simplify the structure of the dataset, each tuple contains one passage, one question and a list that may contain one or more answers to that question, as shown in [this figure](https://gitlab.com/bigirqu/quranqa/-/blob/main/datasets/README.md). 

Each Qur’anic passage in *QRCD* may have more than one occurrence; and each *passage occurrence* is paired with a different question. Likewise, each question in *QRCD* may have more than one occurrence; and each *question occurrence* is paired with a different Qur’anic passage.

The source of the Qur'anic text in QRCD is the [Tanzil project download page](https://tanzil.net/download/), which provides verified versions of the Holy Qur'an in several scripting styles. We have chosen the *simple-clean* text style of Tanzil version 1.0.2.
